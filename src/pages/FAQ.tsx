    }, {
      id: 8,
      question: "What's included in the contact unlock fee?",
      answer: "The contact unlock fee grants you access to the profile's contact information (phone number, email, WhatsApp, etc.). Any arrangement regarding companionship services and their costs is between you and the profile owner after contact has been established."
    }, {
      id: 9,
      question: 'Are there any subscription fees?',
      answer: 'EdenAffairs operates primarily on a pay-per-unlock model rather than subscriptions. However, we do offer optional membership tiers (Silver, Gold, and Diamond) that provide various benefits such as discounted unlock fees, priority support, and enhanced visibility.'
    }, {
